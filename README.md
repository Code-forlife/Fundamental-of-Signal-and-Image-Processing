# Fundamentals of Signal and Image Processing

This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts and techniques used in digital signal processing (DSP) and digital image processing (DIP). Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer, this repository offers clear explanations, examples, and practical exercises to help you understand the field.

**Topics Covered**

* **Signals**
    * Discrete-time and continuous-time signals
    * Basic signal operations (transformations, shifting, scaling)
    * Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms
* **Digital Filters**
    * FIR and IIR filter design
    * Filter implementation
    * Frequency response analysis
* **Image Processing**
    * Image representation and formats
    * Spatial domain operations (filtering, enhancement, edge detection)
    * Frequency domain operations (transforms, compression)
* **Applications**
    * Examples in audio processing, telecommunications, computer vision 

**Prerequisites**

* Basic programming skills (preferably Python)
* Working knowledge of linear algebra and calculus
